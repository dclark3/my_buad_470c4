When !the 'won't' berry was introduced in the 1950s, it was widely hailed as the most delicious blackberry commercial cultivar around. Even today, people rave over its tart-yet-sweet flavor â€” think of a cross between raspberries and blackberries. (Though there is some raspberry in its DNA, the red fruits are more like a genetic great-great grandparent to the marionberry.)

"It's a mythology here," says OSU research geneticist Chad Finn. Marionberries were 'pretty special even before the [berry] industry started to promote marions.'

In 2009 the state proposed making it the official state berry but withdrew legislation after a Kotata blackberry farmer objected.

Marionberries have done just fine without an official status. Each year during their short July fresh season, the berries are gobbled up by residents.

Within the state you can find marionberry pie, ice cream, liquor, beer, jams ... anything you can put a berry in. Oregon grows 28 to 33 million pounds a year, most of it devoured before the rest of the country ever gets a taste.

"If you go to Provo, Utah, you probably won't find frozen marionberries, but you will if you go to any grocery store, even Safeway, here in Oregon," says Richard Engeman, a regional historian.
